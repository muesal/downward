Welcome to the presentation about my thesis " Mutex based potential heuristics".
The main goal of my thesis was to reproduce the work of daniel fiser et alii's recently published paper "strengthening potential heuristics with mutexes and disambiguations"


Heuristics are used in Classical Planning to solve planning tasks.
A planning tasks represents a problem such that it can be solved by an algorithm.
For this, we respresent all possible states, the problem can be in, as states s, which contain facts.
A fact is a pair of a variable uppercase V, and its assigned value lowercase v.
To switch from one state to another, we introduce operators o.
They have a cost, the prize payed for appliyng the operator on a state, a precondition, which holds facts a state must contain that the operator is appliable, and an effect, facts that are new in the resulting states.


one example for a classical planning problem is 15-Puzzle.
It consits of a 4 times 4 grid, and 15 tiles, such that one field remains empty.

Initially, the tiles are in random order, as you can see on the laft hand side.
This is one state of the problem, the respective facts are, that fiel one is assigned tile number nine, field two holds tile number 2 and so one.
The operators which could be applied are to move tile 3 to the right, tile 7 down, 1 to the left and 4 upwards.
The goal is to reach the goal state, which you can see on the right hand side and where the tiles are sorted by number.


This is, where we use the heuristic.
A heuristic is a function, which assignes each state a numerical value, or in our case all reachable states.
Search alogirthms use this heuristical value to decide on where to coninue the search.
The perfect heuristic assignes each state the cost of its optimal plan.
The optimal plan is the path from the state to the goal state with minimal cost among all possible plans from this state to the goal.
One research focus of the time being is to approach the perfect heuristic.

One dimensional potential heuristics, which were the main foucs of my thesis, assign a numerical value, the potential, to each fact of the problem.
The heuristic value of a state is the sum over the potentials of all facts in this state

The potentials are obtained with a linear programm, or short LP.
The LP consits of constraints, these are inequalities, and an optimization function, which is a linar combination potantials
The LP computes potentials, such that the optimization function is optimized, and all inequalities hold.
They assure, that the resulting heuristic has certain properties, like admissibility.

By using different optimization function, we obtain different potentials and therefore different heuristics.
With using mutexes and disambiguations we try to strengthen certain optimization functions, and make the LP less constrained.
