\mytodo{
mutexes and disambiguations are an enhancement (verbesserung) but the er too expensive and therefore their coverage is not better.
The additional constraint on the initial state on the other hand is good.
A method which we developed, the additional constraints on random states, are an enhancement too, but not that much
