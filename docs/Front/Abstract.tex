\chapter{Abstract}\label{ch:abstract}

Potential heuristics assign a numerical value, the potential, to each fact of a classical planning problem.
The heuristic value of a state is the sum over the potentials belonging to the facts contained in the state.
\citeauthor{fivser2020strengthening} recently proposed to strengthen potential heuristics utilizing mutexes and disambiguations.
In this thesis, we embed the same enhancements in the planning system Fast Downward.
The experimental evaluation shows that the strengthened potential heuristics are a refinement, but too computationally expensive to solve more problems than the non-strengthened potential heuristics.

The potentials are obtained with a Linear Program.
\citeauthor{fivser2020strengthening} introduced an additional constraint on the initial state and we propose additional constraints on random states.
The additional constraints improve the amount of solved problems by up to 5\%.
