First I want to thank Prof. Dr. Malte Helmert for the opportunity of writing my bachelor thesis in the AI groupt at the University of Basel.
I am very grateful for the support of Salom\'e, who patiently answered all my questions and guided me through this work.

Last, I want to thank Ada Lovelace, the first programmer there was.
You are an inspiration for all women and show us, that we are essential for mathematical achievements.
Without you, none of this would have been possible.
